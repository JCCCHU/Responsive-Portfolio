# Responsive Portfolio Assignment
The goal of this assignment was to create a functional and visually appealing website using HTML and CSS learned thus far.

Visitors are taken first to the homepage, where they're greeted with a brief message from me.

On the Contact Me page, users can fill out a form for fun and hit the submit button if they want to. It presently sends no information, however.

On the Portfolio page, users are greeted with a couple of suggestions for fun activities.

Users can navigate the site by clicking links on the navigation bar.
